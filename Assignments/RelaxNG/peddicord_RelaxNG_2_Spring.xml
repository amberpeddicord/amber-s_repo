    <greeting to="LAD">Dearest of All Boys,</greeting>
    <body>Your letter was delightful, <color which="red">red</color> and <color which="yellow"
            >yellow</color> wine to me; but I am sad and out of sorts. <persRef who="LAD"
            >Bosie</persRef>, you must not make scenes with me. They kill me, they wreck the
        loveliness of life. I cannot see you, so Greek and gracious, distorted with passion. I
        cannot listen to your curved lips saying hideous things to me. I would sooner be blackmailed
        by every <occupation type="renter">renter</occupation>
        <note resp="DOL">["renter"was a slang term for male prostitutes]</note> in London than to
        have you bitter, unjust, hating.You are the divine thing I want, the thing of grace and
        beauty; but I don't know how to do it.Shall I come to <placeRef where="Salisbury"
            >Salisbury</placeRef>? My <money unit="pounds" amount="49">bill here is 49
            pounds</money> for a week. I have also got a new sitting-room over the Thames. Why are
        you not here, my dear, my wonderful boy? I fear I must leave; <money>no money</money>,
            <money>no credit</money>, and a heart of lead.</body>
    <closing from="OW">Your own, Oscar</closing>
