    <body>... I hope you will call &amp; see, if she is now in <location type="city"
            id="philadelphia">the city</location>, one of the most interesting cases of escape from
        slavery that you have ever seen. She was sent from <location type="city" id="philadelphia"
            >this city</location>
        <date when="24-06-1842">yesterday</date>
        <time when="morning">morning</time> &amp; consigned to <person id="Mr._J">Mr.
            Johnston</person>. She is from <location type="state" id="North_Carolina"
            >N.C.</location> was brought away by a <person id="id_unknown" occupation="sea_captain"
            >sea captain.</person> She was sold by her <person id="id_unknown"
            occupation="slaveowner">master</person> to the speculators &amp; to avoid being sent
        away she was hidden for <time_elapse unit="years" n="7">7 years</time_elapse>! in a small
        upper room of a house occupied by colored people &amp; within <distance unit="yards" n="100"
            >a hundred yards</distance> of her master's house, who did not know she was there. She
        had not seen <person id="id_unknown">her boy</person>, for <time_elapse unit="years" n="7">7
            years</time_elapse> till within <time_elapse unit="days" n="3">3 days</time_elapse> of
        her coming away. She has been shut up so long that she can hardly walk. <person
            id="id_unknown">Another woman</person> was brought away from <location type="state"

            >Mr. Johnston</person> was the man he ought to be, he would invite you occasionally to
        see some of these remarkable cases, which are continually passing from <location type="city"
            id="philadelphia">Phil.</location> to <location type="state" id="New_York"
            >N.Y.</location>
