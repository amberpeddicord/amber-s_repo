                <h2>Teen Titans Project</h2>
                <p class="projects">In Spring of 2020, Amber joined the <a href="http://teentitans.newtfire.org/">Teen Titans Project</a>, originally started by Lauren McNeill and Shannon Dunn in the Fall of 2019. This project aims to create an online resource for the popular television and comic series Teen Titans. The goal of the project was initially to create a comparison between the comic issues and television series, as well as providing some analysis of dialogue and other various analytics. 2020 brought the new goal of mapping character movement in Season 2 of the television show.</p>
